## Key Procedures
Two specific diagnostic procedures should always be performed whenever an ear infection is suspected:  
1. **Otoscopic examination**  
2. **Cytological examination** of the discharge

## Otoscopic Examination
- Aim:  
  - Detect ==**foreign bodies**== or **==ear mites==**  
  - Assess the condition of the ==**vertical and horizontal canals**==  
  - Check the **==appearance and integrity== ==of the tympanic membrane**==  
  - Characterize the ==**type of exudate** present==  

- Important notes:  
  - If the condition is **unilateral**, always ==examine the **good ear first**== → prevents spread of infection + keeps the most uncomfortable procedure until last.  
  - In some cases, the ear canal may be too ==**painful, swollen, or full of exudate**== → prevents meaningful examination.  
    - Options:  
      - ==Sedate or anaesthetize== the animal for examination.  
      - Start a preliminary course of treatment, then re-examine after a few days.  
    - Choice depends on **severity** and clinician’s **suspicion** of underlying causes.  
  - A **full otoscopic examination** must be performed at some stage in every case.

## Cytological Examination
- Must be performed on the ==**first visit** and **all subsequent visits**==.  
- Can be done even ==if otoscopy isn’t possible due to pain.==  
- Benefits:  
  - Allows immediate differentiation of infectious agents:  
    - ==**Co[^1]cci**==  
    - ==**[^3]Rods**==  
    - ==**[^2]Malassezia**==  
  - **Cocci / Malassezia** → empirical treatment can be prescribed (sensitivity predictable).  
  - **Rods** → always perform **bacterial culture & sensitivity testing** ==(resistance is common with Gram-negative organisms)==.  
- Culture should also be done if:  
  - The case **fails to respond** to treatment.

## Practical Strategies for Routine Ear Cytology
If there are time constraints, cytology can still be incorporated by:  
- Training a **qualified nurse** to stain and examine samples while the client waits.  
- Admitting the **dog for a short time** and performing the test later when time allows.  
- Taking the sample and examining it later.  
  - At the same time, collect a **sterile swab for possible culture**.  
  - Submit the culture only if **rods** are seen.  
  - ⚠️ Less desirable: because cytology results should ideally guide **treatment choice**.  
  - Best practice: client collects medication later, after test results are available.

##  Determining Underlying Cause
- In addition to diagnosing and treating the infection, clinicians must identify the **underlying cause**, especially in animals with ==**recurrent otitis**==.  
- Failure to address underlying cause → many cases become ==**chronic or recurrent**.==
